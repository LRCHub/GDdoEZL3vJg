[00:15.64] How can one become so bounded
[00:17.58] By choices that somebody else makes?
[00:22.69] How come we've both become a version
[00:25.92] Of a person we don't even like?
[00:31.97] We're in love with the world
[00:34.15] But the world just wants to bring us down
[00:39.78] By putting ideas in our heads
[00:42.32] That corrupt our hearts somehow
[00:48.47] When I was a child
[00:50.77] Every single thing could blow my mind
[00:56.19] Soaking it all up for fun
[00:58.86] But now I only soak up wine
[01:05.10] They say to play hard, you work hard
[01:07.59] Find balance in the sacrifice
[01:13.03] Yet I don't know anybody
[01:15.78] Who's truly satisfied
[01:21.00] You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
[01:25.08] To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
[01:29.84] But the higher we climb
[01:31.94] Feels like we're both none the wiser (ahh)
[01:37.58] So I hope I learn to get over myself
[01:45.30] Stop trying to be somebody else
[01:53.77] So we can love each other for free
[02:02.09] Everybody wants something
[02:05.31] You just want me
[02:11.82] Why am I obsessing
[02:13.45] About the things I can't control?
[02:19.04] Why am I seeking approval
[02:21.64] From people I don't even know?
[02:27.49] In these crazy times I hope to find
[02:30.43] Something I can cling on to
[02:35.47] 'Cause I need some substance in my life
[02:38.52] Something real, something that feels true
[02:43.57] You better believe for you I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)
[02:48.40] High tides (high tides, high tides)
[02:52.65] 'Cause I want you so bad
[02:54.57] But you can't fight fire with fire (ahh)
[02:59.25] Oh, so I hope I learn to get over myself
[03:08.00] Stop trying to be somebody else
[03:16.28] Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love)
[03:19.12] Love you for free (each other for free)
[03:24.51] Everybody wants something from me
[03:28.52] You just want me
[03:33.08] Listen, I know how low I can go
[03:36.77] I give as good as I get
[03:42.94] You get the brunt of it all
[03:45.75] 'Cause you're all I've got left
[03:50.34] Oh, I hope in time (hope in time)
[03:53.22] We both will find (we both find) peace of mind
[03:58.46] Sometimes the road less traveled
[04:01.31] Is a road best left behind (ahh)
[04:05.10] Well, I hope I learn to get over myself
[04:14.17] Stop trying to be somebody else
[04:22.69] Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love)
[04:25.94] Love you for free, yeah (each other for free)
[04:30.75] 'Cause everybody wants something from me
[04:34.30] You just want me
[04:39.52] You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
[04:44.10] To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
[04:48.37] But the higher we climb
[04:50.45] Feels like we're both none the wiser
[05:21.85] The only regret I have
[05:27.28] I wish that it was just at a different time
[05:31.69] A most turbulent period of my life
[05:38.39] Why would I put that on you?
[05:42.00] That's just like a very heavy thing to have to talk about
[05:48.25] But because of that period of time
[05:50.90] Even though it was so much fun
[05:55.01] I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him
[06:01.33] There was just memories in a big storm
